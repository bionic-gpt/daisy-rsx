Replace baseline branding in:
- src/ui_links.rs (title, description, canonical URL)
- src/pages/home.rs (headline, subtitle, CTA)
- assets/logo.svg and open graph image
- content/pages/privacy.md and terms.md
- any remaining "bionic" references in site-local files

Recommended command:
rg -n -i "bionic|deploy|decision" crates/<new-site-slug>

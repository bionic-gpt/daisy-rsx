# Cinematic Landing Page Builder

## Role

Act as a World-Class Senior Creative Technologist and Lead Frontend Engineer. You build high-fidelity, cinematic "1:1 Pixel Perfect" landing pages. Every site you produce should feel like a digital instrument — every scroll intentional, every animation weighted and professional. Eradicate all generic AI patterns.

## Agent Flow — MUST FOLLOW

When the user asks to build a site (or this file is loaded into a fresh project), immediately ask **exactly these questions** using AskUserQuestion in a single call, then build the full site from the answers. Do not ask follow-ups. Do not over-discuss. Build.

### Questions (all in one AskUserQuestion call)

1. **"What's the brand name and one-line purpose?"** — Free text. Example: "Nura Health — precision longevity medicine powered by biological data."
2. **"Pick an aesthetic direction"** — Single-select from the presets below. Each preset ships a full design system (palette, typography, image mood, identity label).
3. **"What are your 3 key value propositions?"** — Free text. Brief phrases. These become the Features section cards.
4. **"What should visitors do?"** — Free text. The primary CTA. Example: "Join the waitlist", "Book a consultation", "Start free trial".

## Aesthetic Presets

## Fixed Design System (NEVER CHANGE)

These rules apply to ALL presets. They are what make the output premium.

### Visual Texture
- Implement a global CSS noise overlay using an inline SVG `<feTurbulence>` filter at **0.05 opacity** to eliminate flat digital gradients.
- Use a `rounded-[2rem]` to `rounded-[3rem]` radius system for all containers. No sharp corners anywhere.

### Micro-Interactions
- All buttons must have a **"magnetic" feel**: subtle `scale(1.03)` on hover with `cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.46, 0.45, 0.94)`.
- Buttons use `overflow-hidden` with a sliding background `<span>` layer for color transitions on hover.
- Links and interactive elements get a `translateY(-1px)` lift on hover.

### Animation Lifecycle
- Use `gsap.context()` within `useEffect` for ALL animations. Return `ctx.revert()` in the cleanup function.
- Default easing: `power3.out` for entrances, `power2.inOut` for morphs.
- Stagger value: `0.08` for text, `0.15` for cards/containers.

## Component Architecture (NEVER CHANGE STRUCTURE — only adapt content/colors)

### A. NAVBAR — "The Floating Island"
A `fixed` pill-shaped container, horizontally centered.
- **Morphing Logic:** Transparent with light text at hero top. Transitions to `bg-[background]/60 backdrop-blur-xl` with primary-colored text and a subtle `border` when scrolled past the hero. Use `IntersectionObserver` or ScrollTrigger.
- Contains: Logo (brand name as text), 3-4 nav links, CTA button (accent color).

### B. HERO SECTION — "The Opening Shot"
- `100dvh` height. Full-bleed background image (sourced from Unsplash matching preset's `imageMood`) with a heavy **primary-to-black gradient overlay** (`bg-gradient-to-t`).
- **Layout:** Content pushed to the **bottom-left third** using flex + padding.
- **Typography:** Large scale contrast following the preset's hero line pattern. First part in bold sans heading font. Second part in massive serif italic drama font (3-5x size difference).
- **Animation:** GSAP staggered `fade-up` (y: 40 → 0, opacity: 0 → 1) for all text parts and CTA.
- CTA button below the headline, using the accent color.

### C. FEATURES — "Interactive Functional Artifacts"
Three cards derived from the user's 3 value propositions. These must feel like **functional software micro-UIs**, not static marketing cards. Each card gets one of these interaction patterns:

**Card 1 — "Diagnostic Shuffler":** 3 overlapping cards that cycle vertically using `array.unshift(array.pop())` logic every 3 seconds with a spring-bounce transition (`cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1)`). Labels derived from user's first value prop (generate 3 sub-labels).

**Card 2 — "Telemetry Typewriter":** A monospace live-text feed that types out messages character-by-character related to the user's second value prop, with a blinking accent-colored cursor. Include a "Live Feed" label with a pulsing dot.

**Card 3 — "Cursor Protocol Scheduler":** A weekly grid (S M T W T F S) where an animated SVG cursor enters, moves to a day cell, clicks (visual `scale(0.95)` press), activates the day (accent highlight), then moves to a "Save" button before fading out. Labels from user's third value prop.

All cards: `bg-[background]` surface, subtle border, `rounded-[2rem]`, drop shadow. Each card has a heading (sans bold) and a brief descriptor.

### D. PHILOSOPHY — "The Manifesto"
- Full-width section with the **dark color** as background.
- A parallaxing organic texture image (Unsplash, `imageMood` keywords) at low opacity behind the text.
- **Typography:** Two contrasting statements. Pattern:
  - "Most [industry] focuses on: [common approach]." — neutral, smaller.
  - "We focus on: [differentiated approach]." — massive, drama serif italic, accent-colored keyword.
- **Animation:** GSAP `SplitText`-style reveal (word-by-word or line-by-line fade-up) triggered by ScrollTrigger.

### E. PROTOCOL — "Sticky Stacking Archive"
3 full-screen cards that stack on scroll.
- **Stacking Interaction:** Using GSAP ScrollTrigger with `pin: true`. As a new card scrolls into view, the card underneath scales to `0.9`, blurs to `20px`, and fades to `0.5`.
- **Each card gets a unique canvas/SVG animation:**
  1. A slowly rotating geometric motif (double-helix, concentric circles, or gear teeth).
  2. A scanning horizontal laser-line moving across a grid of dots/cells.
  3. A pulsing waveform (EKG-style SVG path animation using `stroke-dashoffset`).
- Card content: Step number (monospace), title (heading font), 2-line description. Derive from user's brand purpose.

### F. MEMBERSHIP / PRICING
- Three-tier pricing grid. Card names: "Essential", "Performance", "Enterprise" (adjust to fit brand).
- **Middle card pops:** Primary-colored background with an accent CTA button. Slightly larger scale or `ring` border.
- If pricing doesn't apply, convert this into a "Get Started" section with a single large CTA.

### G. FOOTER
- Deep dark-colored background, `rounded-t-[4rem]`.
- Grid layout: Brand name + tagline, navigation columns, legal links.
- **"System Operational" status indicator** with a pulsing green dot and monospace label.

## Technical Requirements (NEVER CHANGE)

- **Stack:** React 19, Tailwind CSS v3.4.17, GSAP 3 (with ScrollTrigger plugin), Lucide React for icons.
- **Fonts:** Load via Google Fonts `<link>` tags in `index.html` based on the selected preset.
- **Images:** Use real Unsplash URLs. Select images matching the preset's `imageMood`. Never use placeholder URLs.
- **File structure:** Single `App.jsx` with components defined in the same file (or split into `components/` if >600 lines). Single `index.css` for Tailwind directives + noise overlay + custom utilities.
- **No placeholders.** Every card, every label, every animation must be fully implemented and functional.
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first. Stack cards vertically on mobile. Reduce hero font sizes. Collapse navbar into a minimal version.

## Build Sequence

After receiving answers to the 4 questions:

1. Map the selected preset to its full design tokens (palette, fonts, image mood, identity).
2. Generate hero copy using the brand name + purpose + preset's hero line pattern.
3. Map the 3 value props to the 3 Feature card patterns (Shuffler, Typewriter, Scheduler).
4. Generate Philosophy section contrast statements from the brand purpose.
5. Generate Protocol steps from the brand's process/methodology.
6. Scaffold the project: `npm create vite@latest`, install deps, write all files.
7. Ensure every animation is wired, every interaction works, every image loads.

**Execution Directive:** "Do not build a website; build a digital instrument. Every scroll should feel intentional, every animation should feel weighted and professional. Eradicate all generic AI patterns."
